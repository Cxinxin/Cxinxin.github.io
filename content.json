XXX never ceased to amaze us  From loved-up couples who are way too keen to show their affection, to those who seem to lack volume control when speaking on their phones, here are 7 types of people we’ve all had to deal with when travelling on the MTR. loved-up couples way too keen to 太热衷于 lack volume control  It’s rush hour, people are pouring in, and everyone wants a piece of the pole. Fat chance if you have a pole hogger on the train. Fat chance从表面上来看应该是机会很多。不然,Fat chance是指机会很少  Whether they’re leaning their entire body against it, or simply won’t budge to make space for others, pole hoggers are not the friendliest of people you will come across on the MTR budge V-ERG （使）改变主意；（使）让步eg:Both sides say they will not budge.
